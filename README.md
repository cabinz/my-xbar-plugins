# Requirements

- [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar)

# Configuration

## Install Timetable Plugin

Clone this repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cabinz/xbar-timetable
```

Copy the script from local repo to xbar plugin folder:
```shell
cp xbar-timetable/timetable.1m.py ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins
```

Alternatively, you could create a symbolic link to the script (instead of copying it):

```shell
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins
ln -s path/to/timetable.1m.py timetable.1m.py
```

## Customize Your Timetable
Your timetable should be made as a CSV file in the line format of 
```
<Begin Time>,<End Time>,<Event Name>,[<Event Emoji>]
```
The column of emoji is optional, i.e. each line of the following CSV text is valid:
```CSV
23:30,07:30,sleep,ðŸ˜´
07:30,08:30,breakfast,
08:30,10:00,gym
```
As default, the emoji will be displayed in the menu bar if given. For more examples of CSV sheets, see [examples](examples/).

The path to the CSV file needs to be configured in the xbar panel:
![configure xbar variables](docs/configuration.png)

Besides the file path, there are several more customizable variables could be configured in the panel, including font, font size and emoji / remaining time display.

Refresh the xbar plugin (by clicking the top-left button) to make the configuration work!
